# Matlab-Spice-Interface

This repository contains libraries and netlists used.
Actual_netlist_try_216.net is an example of a netlist used for benchmarking the proposed methods.
C3M0030089K contains SiC MOSFET model used.
DPT_PCB3_1MHz contains the circuit representaiton of layout parasitics extracted at 1MHz.

LTSpice-MATLAB interface will also be uploaded here in the incoming weeks, once author is done with cleaning the code and writing documentation.
